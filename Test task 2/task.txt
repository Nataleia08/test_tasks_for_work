Energy Consumption Management System

Objective: Develop a program that manages different types of energy sources, where each source type has unique calculations for energy output based on its characteristics.

Sample Input:
SolarPanel Area 20 Efficiency 15
WindTurbine Height 50 WindSpeedAverage 6
HydroPlant FlowRate 300 Drop 20

Sample Output:
SolarPanel AnnualEnergyOutput 4500
WindTurbine AnnualEnergyOutput 54000
HydroPlant AnnualEnergyOutput 108000

Explanation of Calculations:
 • Solar Panel: Output = Area × Efficiency × 15
 • Wind Turbine: Output = Height × WindSpeedAverage × 150
 • Hydro Plant: Output = FlowRate × Drop × 12

Bonus Points For:
 • Tests
 • Code that is easy to extend to add more energy sources
 - For example: “OffshoreWindTurbine Height 70 WindSpeedAverage 8 CorrosionFactor 0.2”
 - Where: Output = Height × WindSpeedAverage × 160 × (1 - CorrosionFactor)
