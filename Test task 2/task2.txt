Hi Nataliia, the code looks good. I want to ask you to add one more calculation to your code: ResourceDepletionRate.

The input stays the same, here is a revised output:
SolarPanel AnnualEnergyOutput 4500 ResourceDepletionRate 6.67
WindTurbine AnnualEnergyOutput 54000 ResourceDepletionRate 3.33
HydroPlant AnnualEnergyOutput 108000 ResourceDepletionRate 15

Explanation of Calculations:
 • Solar Panel:
 ○ AnnualEnergyOutput = Area × Efficiency × 15
 ○ ResourceDepletionRate = 100 / Efficiency
 
• Wind Turbine:
 ○ AnnualEnergyOutput = Height × WindSpeedAverage × 150
 ○ ResourceDepletionRate = 1000 / (Height * WindSpeedAverage)

 • Hydro Plant:
 ○ AnnualEnergyOutput = FlowRate × Drop × 12
 ○ ResourceDepletionRate = FlowRate / Drop

Bonus Points For:
 • Tests
 • Code that is easy to extend to add more energy sources
 ○ For example: “OffshoreWindTurbine Height 70 WindSpeedAverage 8 CorrosionFactor 0.2”
 ○ Where AnnualEnergyOutput = Height × WindSpeedAverage × 160 × (1 - CorrosionFactor)
And ResourceDepletionRate = 1200 / (Height * WindSpeedAverage * (1 - CorrosionFactor))
